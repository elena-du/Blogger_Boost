# Blogger_Boost
Application is intended to help bloggers learn about themselves, improve their writing and well-being, and become more self-aware. Also, it boosts community collective awareness and help bloggers to learn about and engage with individuals alike. It uses Python (pandas, NLTK, Gensim, prophet, and some more), Dash on top of Flask for web development and data visualization. You can watch conceptual project walk through [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0GTSXV48lE&feature=youtu.be). For any questions about the project, please, email me at elena@dubova.net.
